### Hellow! ðŸ‘‹
Full-stack Javascript developer, entrepreneur in technology and the greatest possible supporter of people and their journeys.

I truly believe in helping people with technology and code. My journey as a lover began in 2012 with the first algorithm classes in college until I arrived in 2019 and discovered my vocation. Since then I breathe code 24 hours a day, every day of the week.
